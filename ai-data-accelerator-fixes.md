# AI Data Accelerator Implementation Fixes

We've made the following fixes to the AI Data Accelerator implementation:

## 1. UI Improvements

1. **Removed green box at top of services page**
   - Changed the background color from `bg-indigo-100` to `bg-indigo-50` to make it more subtle

2. **Fixed transparent header**
   - Changed the header background from `bg-background` to `bg-white` to make it opaque
   - This prevents content from being visible through the header when scrolling

## 2. API Integration

1. **Added mock API endpoints to fix assessment errors**
   - Created `/api/data-accelerator/dimensions` endpoint
   - Created `/api/data-accelerator/questions` and `/questions/quick_diagnostic` endpoints
   - Created `/api/data-accelerator/assessments/anonymous_assessment` endpoint
   - Created `/api/data-accelerator/assessments/[id]/submit_answers` endpoint
   - Created `/api/data-accelerator/assessments/[id]/results` endpoint

2. **Fixed assessment links**
   - Updated links in the service page to point to `/assessment/quick` instead of `/services/accelerator/assessment`

## 3. Menu Structure Improvements

1. **Simplified services menu**
   - Removed "AI Readiness Assessment" from the services dropdown
   - Kept only "Fractional CDO" and "AI Data Accelerator" as main services
   - The AI Readiness Assessment is now accessed through the AI Data Accelerator service page

2. **Created documentation**
   - Added a service-differences.md document explaining the relationships between services
   - This clarifies that the AI Readiness Assessment is part of the AI Data Accelerator framework, not a separate service

## Next Steps

1. **Test the application**
   - Navigate to `/assessment/quick` and complete an assessment
   - Verify that the results display correctly

2. **Deploy the changes**
   - Push the changes to the feature branch
   - Create a pull request to merge into the main branch

3. **Consider further integration with backend**
   - Replace the mock API endpoints with actual backend integration when ready
