# Component Library Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture and principles for our component library, focusing on scalability, maintainability, and reusability.

## Component Organization

### Directory Structure

components/
├── ui/              # Primitive components
│   ├── button/
│   ├── input/
│   └── form/
├── composed/        # Composed components
│   └── forms/
└── layout/         # Layout components
└── templates/

### Component Types

1. **Primitive Components** (`ui/`)
   - Basic building blocks
   - Highly reusable
   - Minimal business logic
   - Examples: Button, Input, Select

2. **Composed Components** (`composed/`)
   - Built from primitive components
   - May contain business logic
   - Specific to feature domains
   - Examples: SearchForm, UserProfile

3. **Layout Components** (`layout/`)
   - Page structure elements
   - Template components
   - Container components

## Component Architecture

### Base Component Pattern
```typescript
// Component structure
├── index.ts        # Public API
├── Component.tsx   # Main component
├── types.ts        # TypeScript interfaces
├── styles.ts       # Styled components/CSS
└── __tests__/     # Component tests


Component Rules

Single Responsibility

Each component should do one thing well
Split complex components into smaller ones
Use composition over inheritance


Props Interface

Clear, well-documented props
Use TypeScript interfaces
Provide sensible defaults
Example:

interface ButtonProps {
  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary';
  size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg';
  disabled?: boolean;
  children: React.ReactNode;
}

State Management

Local state for UI concerns
Props for data and behavior
Clear state ownership



Testing Strategy

Unit Tests

Component rendering
Props validation
Event handling
State changes


Integration Tests

Component interactions
Form submissions
Data flow


Visual Testing

Component styling
Responsive behavior
Theme compliance



Best Practices

Component Design

Make components composable
Keep components pure when possible
Use TypeScript for type safety
Document component APIs


Styling

Use Tailwind utilities
Follow design token system
Maintain responsive design
Support theme variants


Accessibility

Follow WAI-ARIA guidelines
Include keyboard navigation
Support screen readers
Test with accessibility tools



Version Control

File Organization

One component per file
Clear file naming
Consistent directory structure


Git Workflow

Feature branches for new components
PR reviews for component changes
Component documentation updates



Documentation

Component Documentation

Usage examples
Props documentation
Accessibility notes
Browser support


Storybook Stories

Visual documentation
Interactive examples
Prop controls
Theme previews



Future Considerations

Performance

Code splitting
Lazy loading
Bundle size monitoring


Maintenance

Component deprecation process
Breaking change policies
Version management



Version History

2024-12-15: Initial documentation

This structure:
1. Follows industry best practices
2. Aligns with shadcn/ui patterns
3. Provides clear guidelines for development
4. Sets up maintainable patterns

Would you like me to:
1. Explain any specific section in more detail?
2. Add additional sections?
3. Move on to the Design System documentation?
