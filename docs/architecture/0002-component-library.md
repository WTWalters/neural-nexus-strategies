# Architecture Decision Record: Component Library

## Context

As we build out the Neural Nexus Strategies frontend, we need a consistent and scalable approach to component development that supports our goals for maintainability, reusability, and testing.

## Decision

We will implement a hierarchical component library structure with clear organization, testing requirements, and implementation guidelines.

### Directory Structure
```typescript
src/
├── components/
│   ├── ui/              # Primitive components
│   │   ├── button/
│   │   ├── input/
│   │   └── form/
│   ├── composite/       # Composed components
│   │   └── forms/
│   ├── features/        # Feature-specific
│   └── layout/          # Layout components
├── hooks/               # Custom React hooks
├── utils/              # Utility functions
└── tests/              # Test utilities
Component Types

Primitive Components (ui/)

Basic building blocks
Highly reusable
Minimal business logic
Must be fully typed with TypeScript
Must include comprehensive test coverage
Must support theme customization
Must be accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA compliant)
Composite Components (composite/)

Built from primitive components
Should leverage core components
Should maintain consistent styling patterns
Should include integration tests
May contain business logic
Specific to feature domains
Feature Components (features/)

Should be isolated to specific feature domains
Should leverage composite and core components
Should include feature-specific tests
Should follow business domain organization
Layout Components (layout/)

Should be responsive by default
Should support theme customization
Should include layout-specific tests
Page structure elements
Template components
Implementation

Component Architecture

// Component structure
├── index.ts        # Public API
├── Component.tsx   # Main component
├── types.ts        # TypeScript interfaces
├── styles.ts       # Styled components/CSS
└── __tests__/      # Component tests
Component Template

import React from 'react'
import { styled } from '../../../styles'
import { ComponentProps } from './types'

export const Component: React.FC<ComponentProps> = ({
  children,
  ...props
}) => {
  return (
    <StyledComponent {...props}>
      {children}
    </StyledComponent>
  )
}

const StyledComponent = styled.div`
  // Styled components definition
`
Testing Requirements

Unit Tests

Component rendering
Props validation
Event handling
Accessibility checks
State changes
Integration Tests

Component interactions
Form submissions
Data flow
State management
Side effects
Visual Testing

Component appearance
Theme variations
Responsive behavior
Visual regression tests
Best Practices

Component Design

Make components composable
Keep components pure when possible
Use TypeScript for type safety
Document component APIs
Follow single responsibility principle
Styling

Use Tailwind utilities
Follow design token system
Maintain responsive design
Support theme variants
Accessibility

Follow WAI-ARIA guidelines
Include keyboard navigation
Support screen readers
Test with accessibility tools
Version Control

One component per file
Clear file naming
Feature branches for new components
PR reviews for component changes
Component documentation updates
Documentation

Component Documentation

Usage examples
Props documentation
Accessibility notes
Browser support
Storybook Stories

Visual documentation
Interactive examples
Prop controls
Theme previews
Consequences

Positive

Consistent component development patterns
Clear organization and discoverability
Enforced testing standards
Maintainable codebase
Improved developer experience
Negative

Initial setup overhead
Learning curve for new developers
Additional testing requirements
Documentation maintenance
Future Considerations

Performance

Code splitting
Lazy loading
Bundle size monitoring
Maintenance

Component deprecation process
Breaking change policies
Version management
Status

Accepted
