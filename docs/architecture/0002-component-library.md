# Architecture Decision Record: Component Library

## Context

As we build out the Neural Nexus Strategies frontend, we need a consistent and scalable approach to component development that supports our goals for maintainability, reusability, and testing.

## Decision

We will implement a hierarchical component library structure with the following organization:

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── core/           # Base components like Button, Input, Card
│   ├── composite/      # Components composed of multiple core components
│   ├── features/       # Feature-specific components
│   └── layouts/        # Layout components and containers
├── hooks/             # Custom React hooks
├── utils/             # Utility functions
└── tests/             # Test utilities and helpers
```

### Component Guidelines

1. Core Components
   - Must be fully typed with TypeScript
   - Must include comprehensive test coverage
   - Must support theme customization
   - Must be accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA compliant)

2. Composite Components
   - Should leverage core components
   - Should maintain consistent styling patterns
   - Should include integration tests

3. Feature Components
   - Should be isolated to specific feature domains
   - Should leverage composite and core components
   - Should include feature-specific tests

4. Layout Components
   - Should be responsive by default
   - Should support theme customization
   - Should include layout-specific tests

### Testing Requirements

1. Unit Tests
   - Component rendering
   - Props validation
   - Event handling
   - Accessibility checks

2. Integration Tests
   - Component interactions
   - State management
   - Side effects

3. Visual Regression Tests
   - Component appearance
   - Theme variations
   - Responsive behavior

## Implementation

### Component Template
```typescript
import React from 'react'
import { styled } from '../../../styles'
import { ComponentProps } from './types'

export const Component: React.FC<ComponentProps> = ({ 
  children,
  ...props
}) => {
  return (
    <StyledComponent {...props}>
      {children}
    </StyledComponent>
  )
}

const StyledComponent = styled.div`
  // Styled components definition
`
```

### Test Template
```typescript
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'
import { Component } from './Component'

describe('Component', () => {
  it('renders correctly', () => {
    render(<Component>Test</Component>)
    expect(screen.getByText('Test')).toBeInTheDocument()
  })
})
```

## Consequences

### Positive
- Consistent component development patterns
- Clear organization and discoverability
- Enforced testing standards
- Maintainable codebase

### Negative
- Initial setup overhead
- Learning curve for new developers
- Additional testing requirements

## Status

Accepted

## Notes

This ADR should be reviewed quarterly to ensure it continues to meet project needs.
