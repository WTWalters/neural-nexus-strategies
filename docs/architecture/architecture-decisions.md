## ADRs

### ADR-001: Component Library Structure

#### Status
Accepted

#### Context
- Need a scalable component organization
- Must support both primitive and complex components
- Need clear testing patterns
- Must integrate with existing shadcn/ui components

#### Decision
- Use three-tier component structure:
  1. Primitive (`ui/`)
  2. Composed (`composed/`)
  3. Layout (`layout/`)
- Each component follows standard file structure
- Testing colocated with components

#### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Clear organization
- Easy to find components
- Consistent patterns
- Simplified testing

**Negative:**
- More initial setup
- Stricter guidelines to follow

### ADR-002: Design Token System

#### Status
Accepted

#### Context
- Need consistent design language
- Current color naming inconsistencies
- Must support theming
- Need maintainable design system

#### Decision
- Implement hierarchical token system:
  1. Base tokens (raw values)
  2. Semantic tokens (usage-based)
  3. Component tokens (component-specific)
- Use CSS variables for theme support
- Standardize naming conventions

#### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Consistent design
- Easy theme switching
- Maintainable system

**Negative:**
- Migration effort for existing styles
- Learning curve for token system

### ADR-003: Testing Strategy

#### Status
Accepted

#### Context
- Need comprehensive testing
- Must support component library
- Need consistent testing patterns
- Must handle UI state and interactions

#### Decision
- Implement three-level testing strategy:
  1. Unit tests (components)
  2. Integration tests (component interactions)
  3. Visual regression tests
- Use MSW for API mocking
- Colocate tests with components

#### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Comprehensive coverage
- Consistent patterns
- Reliable testing

**Negative:**
- More test maintenance
- Additional setup complexity

### ADR-004: State Management

#### Status
Proposed

#### Context
- Need to manage UI state
- Must handle server state
- Need predictable data flow
- Must be scalable

#### Decision
Considering options:
1. React Context + Hooks
2. Redux Toolkit
3. Zustand
4. TanStack Query + local state

Currently evaluating trade-offs.

#### Consequences
To be determined based on final decision.

## Future Decisions Needed

1. **Authentication Strategy**
   - Session management
   - Token handling
   - Security patterns

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Code splitting
   - Bundle optimization
   - Caching strategy

3. **Error Handling**
   - Error boundaries
   - Error reporting
   - User feedback
