# Architecture Decision Records

## Overview

This document tracks key architectural decisions for the Neural Nexus Strategies frontend implementation.

## Current Decisions

### ADR-001: Base Technology Stack
- Next.js for frontend framework
- TypeScript for type safety
- styled-components for styling
- Jest & React Testing Library for testing
- Payload CMS for content management
- Express.js for backend services

### ADR-002: Component Library Architecture
- Hierarchical component structure
- Strict testing requirements
- Accessibility standards
- See: [0002-component-library.md](./0002-component-library.md)

### ADR-003: Design System Implementation
- Design token system
- Theme management
- Systematic styling approach
- See: [0003-design-system.md](./0003-design-system.md)
