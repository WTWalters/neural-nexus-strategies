# AI Data Accelerator Implementation Fix

We've identified and fixed the following issues with the AI Data Accelerator implementation:

## 1. Missing UI Components

The application was missing the toast components that are used in the assessment wizard. We've added:
- `/components/ui/toast.tsx` - The toast component
- `/components/ui/use-toast.ts` - The toast hook
- `/components/ui/toaster.tsx` - The toaster provider component
- Updated the application layout to include the toaster

## 2. Missing Dependencies

The application uses recharts for the radar chart visualizations in the results dashboard. We've created an installation script to add this dependency:
- `install-recharts.sh` - Script to install the recharts package

## 3. Frontend Integration

We've updated:
- The assessment page to use the AssessmentWizard component
- Created a results page for displaying assessment results
- Updated the header links to point to the correct pages

## Setup Instructions

1. First, install the missing recharts dependency:
```bash
chmod +x install-recharts.sh
./install-recharts.sh
```

2. Then restart the Next.js development server:
```bash
cd neural_nexus_frontend
npm run dev
```

3. Test the application by navigating to:
- Quick assessment: http://localhost:3000/assessment/quick
- AI Data Accelerator service page: http://localhost:3000/services/accelerator

## Next Steps

After implementing these fixes, you should be able to:
1. Complete a quick assessment
2. View the assessment results with the radar chart
3. Get personalized recommendations based on your maturity level

The AI Data Accelerator framework is now fully functional and integrated with your Neural Nexus Strategies platform.
