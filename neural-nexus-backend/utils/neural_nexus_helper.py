"""Neural Nexus development assistant utilizing Anthropic's Claude AI.

This module provides AI-powered assistance for the Neural Nexus Strategies Blog System,
offering code review, implementation verification, and development guidance through
integration with Anthropic's Claude API.

Typical usage example:
    helper = NeuralNexusHelper(api_key='your_anthropic_api_key')

    # Check component implementation
    feedback = helper.check_implementation(
        code='component code here',
        component_name='BlogPost'
    )

    # Ask development questions
    answer = helper.ask_development_question(
        "How should we implement the newsletter integration?"
    )
